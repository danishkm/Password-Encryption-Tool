# Hashing Tool in Python
This Python script allows users to generate secure hashes for a given string using three different hashing algorithms: MD5, SHA1, and SHA224. This tool is useful for verifying data integrity or generating unique identifiers for data. It provides an easy interface for users to input a string and select a hashing algorithm to generate the hash.

# Features
-Choose from three hashing algorithms: MD5, SHA1, and SHA224.
-User-friendly: Simple command-line interface with prompts for input and algorithm selection.
-Reusable functions: Each hashing algorithm has a dedicated function, making it easy to expand or modify.

# How to Use
python hashing_tool.py

# Requirements
Python 3.x: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.

# Notes
Security Warning: MD5 and SHA1 are not recommended for cryptographic security as they are vulnerable to collision attacks. For secure password hashing, consider using stronger algorithms like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2.
